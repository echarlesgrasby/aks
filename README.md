# aks
This program is a utility for extracting n-grams from texts.
It extracts every contiguous string from a collection of texts,
from length 1 up to a maximum length determined by the user.
The included scripts then perform sorting routines on the
n-gram files to determine which strings occur most frequently.
This method is especially useful for texts composed in languages
that do not feature orthographic spacing between individual
words.
